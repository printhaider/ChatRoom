### Introduction 

For this project, we built a project based on Java Socket Programming. The use of Multithreading played a major role in this project. For the language we used JavaFx. We made a mulitple user chat application called "ChatRoom". For the front end development we used JavaFx scenebuilder. This multiplie client chat can let people communicate on the same network.
